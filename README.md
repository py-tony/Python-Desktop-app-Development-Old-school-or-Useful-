# Python Desktop app Development Old school or Useful


Computers without software are almost useless, especially for ordinary users. While the main software (O.S) is needed to do the heavy-lifting, including controlling how other software and hardware behave, a computer needs a list of software to operate and many other applications for a good user experience. In this article, we will discuss the advantages of making desktop applications and a look at Python GUI programming while answering the questions below.

- What are some of the benefits of making GUIs?
- Should I make a web app or a desktop app for my project?
- When I decide to make desktop apps with Python, what do I need to know to be well equipped.?

Let's face it, codes are ugly! As developers, we can only try to make our code a bit beautiful and readable. But codes are still considered as something supernatural to non-developers. It can be intimidating even to developers when looking at code written in an unfamiliar language. That being said, it is a good idea to make a user interface for our programs. Let us unpack that.

## What are some benefits of GUIs? ##

In marketing, images have the reputation of catching people's attention and encouraging them to take action. Well-designed graphics can even do more, they can give clear and very explicit details about the data or the expected action of users. This, in turn, makes the interface appealing and smoothes the interaction with your computer or the Internet. It also adds a sense of accomplishment for the developer.

We all have been there. After designing a program, we are enthusiastic and want to share it with friends or family. But wait a minute. Grandpa does not understand programming languages. Herman my best friend, is a Java developer and does not have python installed on his computer. What do I do? Forcing others to learn how to code and install Python on any other device? Of course not.

Python, like most programming languages, has solutions to challenges, such as web apps, desktop apps, mobile apps, etc. That allows us to make programs with GUIs that can be shared easily via social media or other means of transferring data and can be tested without the need to install all the dependencies required in the development process. This means we cannot make excuses when it comes to GUIs. In this article, we will focus on the Python language and its GUI framework

## Should I make a web app or a desktop app for my project? ##

There is no doubt that web apps are better than desktop apps in many ways. They outperform desktop apps in sales, flexibility, innovation, customization, accessibility, accessibility, update, and deployment. However, they fall short when it comes to security and data privacy. There are other reasons why we might have to use or make desktop apps. 

While it is possible to make a web app calculator, would you not rather prefer a local calculator on your device than surf the net just to get a sum? Do you really need to open a browser to sort out your files in that USB? We do appreciate google docs, but that is nothing compared to excel. Besides their physicality and convenience, some functionalities on desktop apps are internet free. That makes desktop apps the first choice, especially in areas where the internet is expensive or not reliable.  

From a developer viewpoint, we all don't have to convert to web development or graphic designers to be able to make some Graphics to allow users to interact with our programs. Many programming languages, like Python, have come up with some good solutions to this problem that sometimes doesn't need extra settings or installations. In this article, we will focus on the Python language. 

To get started with web apps development in python, you need to learn a list of web concepts and a few languages like CSS and HTML. However, making a quick graphical interface for your program that can be executed on your computer may be more convenient than you thought.

To give you a taste of what you can expect, run from your Python Shell or IDE;

```
import TKinter as tk

tk._test()
``` 
This checks if Tkinter is installed. Since TKinter generally comes pre-installed with python. You should get a GUI displayed. 

If you run into trouble you might want to manually install(link) Tkinter.

Otherwise, congratulations! You just made a useless GUI.

In the code above, we just imported the Tkinter library and use its test function to display a test widget. Later on, we will learn more about the libraries and frameworks.


## When I decide to make GUI apps with python, what do I need to know to be well equipped? ##

Great decision, and have no fear! Python is still one of the 5 best programming languages for desktop apps. So we are not going in the wrong direction. In fact, the python IDLE itself was built with python using the very same library we just tried now (Tkinter). If you already know python you could jump right into Tkinter and start building some GUI.

However, there is no easy way to become a desktop app developer. 
Wait what? Didn't you just say it was easy? 
Yes I did!
So you were lying?

Sorry Jack, life is not that easy. The truth is that web apps are fairly complex to make than desktop apps. Think about it, you need to learn at least three different coding languages for your style, markup, and query language on top of the framework language. Then you have to worry about how to roll it out, where to get the domain name, who will host your site, etc., etc. With desktop app development, guess how many languages you need to learn? Well, you guessed it right! One! You might be expected to be familiar with some CSS or styling standards. But that is not a hard requirement. Does that mean that this is going to be an easy journey?

Python desktop app developers are expected to have a solid understanding of;

This shouldn't be a surprise. If we are to develop stuff with Python we need to be familiar, if not comfortable with the language. If you have no knowledge of the language, you can start by learning it. Python is one the easiest and most elegant programming languages to learn, and you can even find volunteer mentors for free like @pyTony.

- Object orientated programming (OOP)
There is a concept called DRY in programming, and OOP helps you to achieve just that. Besides, saving you from repeating codes and logic in your program OOP also makes your code look more clean and maintainable.

- Libraries

 Like the literal meaning suggests(a room containing a collection of books), programming libraries aim to facilitate some configurations and comes with prewritten codes to help us achieve specific tasks. There are several libraries in Python to accomplish different tasks. When it comes to GUIs, we still have some decisions to make about which library will suit a given project or our programming style. Having the ability to use them effectively and understand when and why to do so is a skill we shouldn't overlook. (Resource)

- Framework

Frameworks speed the development process. They provide blueprints and solutions that are tailored for a given task. A framework can be thought of as a workplace where things are structured and things must be done according to a certain method. While the words library and framework are often used interchangeably in programming, they are different. Understanding their differences will empower us to know when and why to use them. For an in-depth comparison of libraries and frameworks in computer science, check out this article.

As a bonus, we're going to have a quick look at the two of the most popular Frameworks in Python

## Tkinter Vs Pyqt5 ##

Of course, there are many frameworks to build GUIs in python, Tkinter and Pyqt are just two of the most popular we can find out there. While these tools have one goal in common which is helping you build GUIS, they differ in style and approaches.

-         Tkinter

Think of Tkinter more like a library than a framework because it allows you to write GUIs yourself, program your settings or functionality in the same script. It offers more learning opportunities and is easy to control. It is also not strict on OOP and MVC(model, view, control) programming style which makes it suitable for simple tasks. Check out this article by Prachi Prakash for a Guide to Standard GUI library in Python with TKinter.

-         Pyqt5

Think of Pyqt as a Framework because there are standards that you need to follow. You might have to separate your GUI script separately from your python script (where youâ€™re writing your logic of the application). Your GUI script is generally generated automatically by another tool called QT designer. You are expected to have a stable knowledge of OOP and be Familiar with MVC. Pyqt5 is also only supported in Python v3.5 and later.
 

## Conclusion ##

The Python programming language has proven to be useful in a range of ways. Its elegance and simplicity, which emphasize natural language, makes it a good choice even for newcomers to programming. As we saw in this article, the language has potential use in developing desktop apps. We also highlighted the advantages of making desktop apps and use-cases compared to web apps. We did not intend to discourage the use or development of web applications. We strongly believe that web apps play a vital role in the world of software because of their flexibility and accessibility. In the article, the author aimed to encourage or empower developers to create GUIs without needing to switch to another form of development or having to think about studying graphic design.
