"""

We can convert any tkinter application to an exe compatible file format using the PyInstaller package in Python.

To work with pyinstaller, first install the package in the environment by using the following command,

pip install pyinstaller
Once installed, we can follow the steps to convert a Python Script File (contains a Tkinter application file) to an Executable file.

Install pyinstaller using pip install pyinstaller in Windows operating system. Now, type pyinstaller --onefile -w filename and press Enter.

Now, check the location of the file (script file) and you will find a dist folder which contains the executable file in it.

When we run the file, it will display the window of the tkinter application.
